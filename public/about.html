<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Florian Kern and I'm currently studying Computer Games Technology at the Fachhochschule Wedel
  in Germany. While video games are my passion, I love to create media and I'm currently practicing to become a web developer.
</p>

<p>I would describe myself as a very optimistic person that always tries to see the best in a maybe bad situation.
  I love working in groups and exchange knowledge about basically anything that someone wants to talk about.
  My greatest asset would be my perserverence. If I'm met with a problem, I want to solve it. 
</p>

<p>I love to learn and am continuously sharpening my skills as a developer. Furthermore I spend my free time watching movies,
  talking to my friends or keep myself up-to-date with the latest trends in regards to the video game industry.
  If you want to learn more about me as a person, feel free to reach out to me!
